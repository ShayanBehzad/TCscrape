# TCscrape
This code scrapes data from Truecar website and inserts them into database.
I used mysql as my database management system.
In the first step, the user must create his database separately and insert the database name and information in the Stabilizer part (user, password, host, databasename).
Then run the code and enter the name of the desired car brand in the input field.
The information of the available cars of the desired car brand is stored in the database and can be viewed.
